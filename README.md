# Hand-Gesture-Detection
For human-computer interaction, hand gesture recognition is essential.
Gesture recognition is the process of determining the user's gestures using a computer. Many hand gesture recognition technologies have been developed up to this point, but Video-Based Hand Gesture Detection with high efficiency and low computational cost remains a difficult task.
The goal is to create a cutting-edge prototype for creating a real-time online hand gesture detection system with minimal latency and great efficiency. At any moment, a user can make a hand gesture in front of a web camera that is coupled to high-end computing that captures motions and analyses and recognizes them. The gesture is recognized and displayed on the process's screen. For online action detection, the recognition procedure must be quick and precise. A feature extraction tool Media pipe has been used for extracting the co-ordinates from the data points of the human hand made into a dataset which is acted upon by several models and the performance of the model is measured through accuracy of classification and the results are presented.
